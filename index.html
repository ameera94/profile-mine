        <p class="rspb">"The isolation, purification and characterization of unknown neurotoxin produced by A1 reactive astrocytes." In this final project, students were tasked with producing a written research proposal grant as well as delivering this as a presentation to a panel of experts. This involved constructing a hypothesis that had not been explored or experimented on in previous literature based on critical appraisal of current literature. An experimental strategy then had to be devised as well as techniques for measuring and recording outcomes and evaluating and processing the data obtained. A feasible timeline, schedule and budget were all produced.</p>
